# üêç ALX Backend Engineering ‚Äì Week 2: Introduction to Python

Welcome to Week 2 of the ALX Backend Engineering program! This week marked the beginning of my journey into **Python programming** ‚Äî a powerful, versatile, and beginner-friendly language used across a wide range of tech domains.

This project introduced Python fundamentals, including setting up a development environment, writing basic scripts, understanding syntax rules, and practicing simple arithmetic and user input operations.

## üéØ Project Objectives

By the end of this week, I was able to:

- Define what Python is and explain its characteristics as a high-level programming language.
- Identify common application areas for Python (e.g., web development, data science, automation).
- Set up a development environment using Git, GitHub, and Git Bash.
- Understand Python‚Äôs focus on clean syntax and the importance of indentation.
- Write and run basic Python programs using variables, user input, and arithmetic operations.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Covered

- Performed basic arithmetic operations using Python variables.
- Calculated simple interest using a predefined formula.
- Computed the area of a rectangle using length and width values.
- Converted hours into seconds using simple multiplication.
- Built a script that calculates future age based on current age input.
- Developed a personal finance calculator that estimates monthly savings and projected annual savings with interest.

All tasks were completed using fundamental Python constructs such as variable assignments, arithmetic operations, user input handling, and formatted output. These exercises were crucial in building confidence and fluency with Python syntax.

## üí° Reflections

This week has been foundational and incredibly motivating. It was my first hands-on experience with Python, and I genuinely enjoyed the simplicity and elegance of the language. I particularly loved working on Big O notation ‚Äî it sparked a deeper curiosity for data structures and algorithms.

I‚Äôve also discovered that backend development is both logical and creative. Each script I wrote gave me a better understanding of how things work behind the scenes. I'm slowly falling in love with backend development ‚Äî and while I still appreciate frontend, I‚Äôm excited to see where this new path leads me.
